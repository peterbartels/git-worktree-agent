# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to use

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select what type of change this is (major/minor/patch)
2. Write a summary of the change

The changeset file will be committed with your PR. When your PR is merged to main, the release workflow will:
1. Collect all changesets
2. Create a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps and changelog updates
3. When that PR is merged, publish to npm

## More info

You can find the documentation for Changesets [on GitHub](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
